# Professional Identity of Journalists in Japan #

## Abstract ##

## Introductions ##

## Ideology of Journalism ##

> • Public service: journalists provide a public service (as watchdogs or ‘news-hounds’, active collectors and disseminators of information);
> • Objectivity: journalists are impartial, neutral, objective, fair and (thus) credible;
> • Autonomy: journalists must be autonomous, free and independent in their work;
> • Immediacy: journalists have a sense of immediacy, actuality and speed (inherent in the concept of ‘news’);
> • Ethics: journalists have a sense of ethics, validity and legitimacy. [@Deuze:2005 p447]

Where and when are these beliefs about journalism acquired?

## Journalism in Japan ##

### Public service ###

Journalists relations with the 'public' - public journalism? Surveys of J journos understandings of the audience?

### Objectivity ###

### Autonomy ###

What is it that allows the journalist this autonomy? Identity as a professional that extends beyond the fact that they work for a company which 'does news'. Basis for maintaining the chinese wall between business and editorial, insulation from source pressure etc.

### Immediacy ###

### Ethics ###
Limited to the company motto!
