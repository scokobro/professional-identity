abstract: The role of a professional identity for journalists around the world is part of what allows them to act as the watchdogs on power that society expects. How and where is this identity acquired? Is Japan different? If so does this explain the idiosyncratic nature of journalistic activity in Japan?

# Introduction #

Japan has fallen down the press freedom rankings over the past few years, it's still up there in the 'free' zone but such a rapid fall must be cause for concern.

During a press conference at the end of his visit in ??? 2016 UN Special Rapporteur reported journalists concerns in these terms;

> quote 1

He summarise his experience of talking to various actors within the Japanese mass media system as ...

> the problem is, the system of journalism and the structure of media itself in Japan doesn't seem to afford journalists the ability to push back against government encroachments, and you see this [...] in the example of the *kisha* club system, we learned about serious concern about senior member of the independent media meeting with senior members of the govt., we heard these stories repeatedly, and I would really encourage journalists to organise themselves, to adopt a professional organisation, a union in effect, in which journalists can express media-wide solidarity, can perhaps enjoy self-regualtion through a press council, in short, the media itself has a role to play, the media itself bears some responsibility for this situation

<!--  and I hope thes two different tasks [change law, organise] could protect the independence fo the press. -->

The question is: Why, given the obvious concern with independence and what Kaye describes as the deep committment to freedom of speech and expression in Japan, have journalists not organised in the way he describes?

This paper argues that the root causes of this failure to organise, can be found in a) the nature of the professional education of journalists, and b) the nature of employment structures for journalists in Japan.

This has led to a situation where reporter identity is centred on entities - companies as employers - which are required (at least as far as rhetoric is concerned) to be in a relationship of 'fierce competition'.

Are Japanese journalists equipped to push back against the forces that pressure them? Can the 'professional identity' of the journalist be seen as a protective barrier, a layer of insulation, which allows journalists a psychological cushion and promotes the kind of activity and relationships expected of the ethical journalist. Does the lack of this cushion contribute to the state of journalism in Japan at the current time?

This paper will not deal with the influence if the *kisha kurabu* 'press club' system, probably the most widely documented aspect of journalism in Japan, as it has been dealt with extensively  elsewhere[see, for example @Freeman:2000], but it is worth summarising the effects of press club journalism; the collective responsibility implied by press club membership leaves the press open to pressure both from peers - to not rock the boat and upset relations with sources - and from sources who can deny access more or less at will. Given the possibilities offered by social media for politicians to simply bypass the main stream media, it is difficult to see how the traditional "balance of power" for control of access (press to politicians, politicians to the public) can be maintained. Japanese politics has been rather late to the social media jamboree with the use of online campaigning prohibited until 200?, but this will change.[@Osaka:2014]

# Ideology of Journalism

Discussion of the elements of the nature of the journalistic identity has been an integral part of academic understandings of news and newsgatherers since the very early days of the field (eg?). Deuze[-@Deuze:2005] sums up the essential features of what he refers to as the journalistic ideology:

>   • Public service: journalists provide a public service (as watchdogs or ‘news-hounds’, active collectors and disseminators of information);\
>   • Objectivity: journalists are impartial, neutral, objective, fair and (thus) credible;\
>   • Autonomy: journalists must be autonomous, free and independent in their work;\
>   • Immediacy: journalists have a sense of immediacy, actuality and speed (inherent in the concept of ‘news’);\
>   • Ethics: journalists have a sense of ethics, validity and legitimacy.\

[@Deuze:2005, 447]

Where and when are these beliefs about journalism acquired?

What has been the effect of a strong bureaucratic tradition on the role of professional ideas in journalism in Japan?

# Journalism in Japan #

Japan has a history of journalism stretching back to its emergence from under the control of the Tokugawa Bakufu in the latter decades of the nineteenth century.

Early journalism was often politically sponsored and overtly partial, it was only with the adoption of the 'objective' mass circulation model that the press began to require something like the 'professional' journalist rather than the partisan supporter and advocate of a cause.

First professional journalists - ?

## Development of journalism as a trade

[@Schafer:2012 p10] 1875: formation of *Shimbun Kisha Rengō* in reaction to increasingly restrictive laws which affected the press and protection against libel.[^law]

[^law]:*shimbunshi jōrei*, *zanbōritsu*

1880s - new university graduates began to move into journalism, numbers increased through the 1920s, economic recession meant a dearth of graduate employment opportunities at a time when hte popular press was expanding and looking to increase the quality if its content by employing better educated reporters.[@Schafer:2012 p36]

However along with this shift toward employing individuals who had passed thorugh the system of imperial universities - and reducing the number of 'enthusiasts' - who saw themselves as 'educators of society' - came an increase in the number of 'company employees'. In 1917, Motoyama Hikoichi[^moto] had characterised this shift with the folowing words,

[^moto]: journo at *Osaka Shinpō*, then *Jiji Shinpō*, 1888 reorganised *Osaka Mainichi SB*, became pres in 1903: Advocate of foundation of newspaper studies depts at univs and later president of *Osaka Mainichi* newspaper.[@Schafer:2012 p36n]

> a journalist, just like a salaryman of any other profit-oriented company, needs to spare no efforts in favor of his company. [@Schafer:2012 citing Ono:1971]

The journalist was increasingly seen as primarily a company employee like any other. And the 'Shimbun-gaku' departments established at unoversities were aimed at providing potential journalists with the requisite knowledge to allow them to gain employment at newspapers on graduation. It took until 1929 for a Tokyo Imperial University to etablish a 'Newspaper Research Seminar' as part of its literature department.[@Schafer:2012 p40]

Ono??? was the prime motivator in the establishment of this body, he saw the professional training he sought to offer as a way to push back against the 'degeneration' of the press he perceived in the 1920s, and to raise journalists who would again act as educators of society, ensuring that expert and specialist opionion would be made available to the newspaper's mass audience.[@Schafer:2012 p45--5]

[@Huffman:1997; @Lange:1998]

## Education of Journalists ##

Deuze, in his typology of global journalism education approaches, categorises tha Japanese system as characterised by

> [p]rimarily on-the-job training by the media industry, for example through apprenticeship systems (Austria, Japan; Great Britain and Australia started this way, as this is a typical
feature of the Anglo-Saxon model).[@Deuze:2006 p22]

See parts of...

[@Cooper-Chen:1997a; @Fujita:2004; @Hanada:2003; @Hashimoto:2003a; @Ikuta:2004; @IwabuchiY:2004; @Tsukamoto:1993; @Tsukamoto:2006]

Indeed, outside employment there is little opportunity for potential journalists in Japan to acquire knowledge, skills and experience of their chosen trade.

As a route to employment an education in journalism can be all but irrelevant, as [@Cooper-Chen:1997a p22] suggests, company recruitment relies on testing general skills (general knowledge, literacy) so a degree from *any* department in a prestigious university may be worth more than specialist knowledge from a less prestigious institution. Theses attitudes and the expectations of media employers - virtually no value attached to any sort of university-based journalistic education [@Fujita:2004 p1] in Japan seems to go back to at least the 1930s[@Uchikawa:2003 p14].

Fujita points to changes in the environment for perceived shortcomings of the 'on-the-job training' (OJT) system that led to the debate about the role of journalist education in Japan in the later 1990s and early 00s - the increasing use of technology at all levels of newspaper production and the increased pressure on workers which left little time for senior reporters to train new staffers.[@Fujita:2004 p3]

This debate took place in reaction to a number of incidents (plagiarism[^plag], invasions of privacy, 'overheated' herd reporting (*media sukuramu*), libel)[@Ikuta:2004 p1]. Ikuta also identifies the pressures of adapting to new technologies as a root cause in the drop in journalistic standards.

[^plag]: About one-third of an article in the 8 Jun 2000 edition on the *Asahi Shimbun* was found to have been plagiarised from the local *Chugoku Shimbun* by a reporter in the Hiroshima office.[@Shibata:2003 p137]

Ikuta describes the actual content of OJT at the +as; new employs spend four or five years at a local office where theier development can be overseen trained by experienced reporters, traditionally the local office would be a mix of new, middle career and 'veteran' rporters. However Ikuta argues that this system broke down due to the HR policy of concentrating middle-career reporters in the head offices, which led to an over-reliance on early-career reporters in local bureaus. (ibid. p224/1180)

# Living the ideology?

This section surveys how the five aspects of the journalistic ideology outlined by Deuze(see above) are materialsied in Japan; it concentrates on 'ethics' and 'autonomy' as areas which can be seen to have a particularly significant impact on journalistic practise.

I will deal with the less controversial aspects - public service, objectivity, and immediacy - before moving on.

## Public service

Journalists relations with the 'public' - public journalism? Surveys of J journos understandings of the audience?

Central term for Japanese discussion of the role of journalists is 'the right to know' (*shiru kenri*); this would seem to indicate a pervasive consciousness of journalism as a service to the general public. Of course, this leaves open the question of how this idea is operationalised; in any particular instance, which public is to be served and how?

Willnat survey?

## Objectivity

The prime concern of reporters in Japan (see Weaver info) is the accurate reporting of fact. Is the corollary a reduction in the amount of comment and context provided?

When the broadcasting of television news started on NHK in the 1960s, the newspaper model was adopted as an organisational template and standard.

## Immediacy

No doubt about this. Companies like immediacy as a measure of journalistic performance; results are generally quantifiable and unambiguous - it's usually fairly obvious 'who was first'.

Japanese newspapers still issue *gōgai* sheets, single pages handed out at major railway stations (and thus coincidentally also useful for television news cameras), covering major stories such as ...

## Autonomy

What is it that allows the journalist this autonomy? Identity as a professional that extends beyond the fact that they work for a company which 'does news'. Basis for maintaining the 'chinese wall' between business and editorial, insulation from source pressure etc.

The Japanese journalist, as a result of the diversity of educational backgrounds - surely a strength in terms of diversity of knoweldge - lack any external power base (see article in Tumber!);

TO be autonomius invites suspicion - to be outside a publicly legitimised organisation - the reputation of trades unions, other than the 'company unions' prevalent across much of Japanee industry is as 'trouble makers obsessed with Marxist doctrine'(CHECK!) - is to lose a credibility and social trust. Thus, without some sort of legitimate (by whose standards?) body to which they can refer, journalists are effectively restricted to acting within the bounds of the vertical company-based structure. The 'media-wide' cooperation that David Kaye referred to necessary to effect a concerted push back against top-down pressure is near impossible.

## Ethics

Limited to the company motto!

Discussing the reaction of the New Delhi correspondents of the major Japanese media during the media restrictions which were part of the Emergency (1975?), and the reaction of the mass media in Japan when government took the decision to intervene in the *Tsubaki Hatsugen*[^tsuba] incident (1994?)[@Berger:1995]

[^tsuba]: Explain this

> 日本人ジャーナリストが全員、ジャーナリストとしての使命に生きるよりも、私企業の倫理に従った [@Yamashita:1996 p37]


# Discussion

Inability of J press to act for common good: Yamashita India Emergencey anecdote [@Yamashita:1996 p35--6], also perhaps the profusion of microphones that one sees in front of speakers at a press conference in Japan[^mike] attest the unwillingness (lack of desire) of Japanese media companies to cooperate, even where the benefits are obvious, and the gains from non-cooperation negligible to nil.

[^mike]: It is common paractise in many countries for the host of the press conference to provide feeds of the main microphone audio to all camera crews via a 'break-out box' positioned near to the designated camera position. Among other advantages to this sytem is that it helps reduce visual clutter in front of the speaker.
